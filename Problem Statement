Project Title:
Banking Loan Origination & Approval Workflow

Problem Context:
A bank receives a large number of loan applications (home, car, personal) every day. Currently, the process is manual: applications are collected, verified by staff, routed through multiple approval levels, and tracked via spreadsheets. This results in delays, lost applications, and inconsistent decision-making.

Business Problem:
The bank needs an automated system to capture loan applications, track their status, and manage the initial approval workflow to reduce manual errors and improve processing efficiency.

Phase 1 Scope:

Capture loan applications in Salesforce using custom objects.

Collect basic applicant details: Name, Contact, Loan Type, Loan Amount, and Income Details.

Implement single-level automated approval for initial verification (e.g., loan officer approval).

Generate basic status tracking for applications (Submitted, Approved, Rejected).

Provide a dashboard/report showing applications by loan type and status.

Expected Outcome:

Centralized tracking of all loan applications.

Reduced manual effort and errors in the initial verification process.

Faster decision-making for loan approvals.
